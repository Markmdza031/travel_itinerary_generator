Balite Falls,Balite Falls is a privately owned resort A     meter road from Crisanto Delos Reyes Avenue is the only access to this falls and is accessible to any type of vehicle The resort is not a top notch class resort yet is one of the nearest waterfall spot for the people of Cavite and those coming from Manila From Manila it is only about an hour and a half drive along the Cavite Expressway Cottages are available along the side of the stream and small overnight hostel is available as well as a bar However when I was there it seems that the bar is no longer available except for a karaoke machine The place is suggested to be a good picnic area but not a place that would be good to stay overnight Amenities are not that top notch There is only a single restroom for the whole resort and   dressing rooms There is no shower room as the area already has natural fresh water flowing from the pipes along the side of the stream which can be used as a shower The water from the catch basin of the falls was artificially blocked by sand bags to maintain the basin with sufficient water for swimming The bad thing about it is that because it is blocked and it takes time before the water to flow freely to the stream the catch basin water tends to be murky when more people are there Anchovies and tadpoles swim along with you Not in great numbers though And this is also one of the effects when you block a natural waterway the fishes tend to stay in one place as well The falls itself is a beauty Not something you expect as a big waterfall as it can be safely said that Balite Falls is more of a stream as the area to where it is located is a plain land There are no mountains nearby Just right where the falls fall from the rock is a deep area A rope line has been placed by the management to warn people that if you go beyond that rope and get near the falls is already    feet deep Entrance fee is a bit of a turn off With few amenities that the resort can offer it charges P   per person for   years old and above Much more expensive than Sto Nino Cold Spring at Camiguin to which this resort is almost similar that costs only P   pax for an entrance fee The verdict is that Balite Falls is an ample spot for people who are on a budget and would like to swim or a have a picnic get together with your family and friends if you happen to just had been to Tagaytay City Balite Falls is one of the newly discovered hidden tourist spots in Cavite Itís a small waterfall roughly    feet high But it has an entrancing pool with crystal clear waters If youíre up for a thrill try jumping from the top of the falls to the pool Just make sure youíre an expert swimmer Balite Falls is nestled in a simple but clean and peaceful resort in the town of Amadeo The latter is famous for its coffee many coffee shops get their supply of beans from this town A stream running through the resort drops down on a small shallow pool before cascading down into a larger and deeper pool at another lower level The two waterfalls thus formed are the centerpiece of the resort The waters of the stream and falls are relatively clean The resort is covered in lush vegetation and is ideal for picnics or a quiet getaway When we arrived on the morning of our first visit there were just a few people around most of them preparing for a picnic and fewer still taking a dip in the pool As noon approached however the place started to get more visitors The warm and courteous hosts told us that the place really fills up during the summer
