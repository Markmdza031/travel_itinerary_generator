Taal Heritage Town,"Taal Heritage Town One of the most popular things to do in Batangas is visiting the heritage town of Taal, Batangas, which is like traveling back in time. Taal reigns as one of the most culturally preserved sites of the Spanish colonial era in our country.

Must-visit are the old houses of Taal, the Taal Basilica which is known as the ""Biggest Catholic Church in Asia"", Taal Public Market where you could buy Tapang Taal, Caysasay Shrine and the Sacred Well of Sta. Lucia, among other interesting heritage and historical sites.   The Well-preserved Spanish Colonial Town of Taal Caysasay Shrine and the Sacred Well of Sta. Lucia The Heritage Houses of Taal ","Taal was originally located in what is now the town of San Nicolas near the Taal Lake. The former provincial capital was forced to relocate to its present location when the Taal Volcano violently erupted in the mid-18th century. Although commercialization is apparent, the town center still elicits that strong old town vibe with the well-preserved town hall building and ancestral houses flanking the streets. But the town s highlight is the Basilica de San Martin de Tours (or simply Taal Basilica), said to be the biggest Catholic church in Asia. Sitting atop a hill, it definitely commands attention and an iconic landmark. If you get hungry, you can try some of Batangas  signature dishes like the tapang Taal and Taal longganisa. You can order these at Don Juan BBQ near Taal Market, where you can also go food tripping or pasalubong shopping. If you have more time, you can also check out the Taal-made Barong Tagalong, balisong-making, and Taal embroidery products.","The most interesting part of going around Taal town proper is having to see the heritage houses that allow people to travel back in time as their unique exquisiteness from the olden days was preserved for the present generation to catch a glimpse of. Some of these heritage houses were turned into museums, others into galleries, a couple of them were transformed into gift shops. But in general, these heritage houses serve as concrete proofs of the rich cultural heritage passed on from one generation to the succeeding one.

The well-known Sombrero Island, which is often associated with Anilao, is actually part of Tingloy too. Another beach destination in Tingloy is Oscar Beach, sometimes called by the locals as Oscar Island. All these pieces of tropical paradise make Tingloy one of the fastest rising tourist destinations in the country.","Until very recently, Masasa Beach was a concealed gem, stashed away from the watchful eye of weekend warriors from Manila. But something this precious is hard to keep secret. As soon as word got out, tourists came in droves, rattling what used to be a dormant town. Masasa Beach is arguably the best beach in Tingloy, the only municipality in Batangas that is not on mainland Luzon. Its main island is the fish-shaped Maricaban, off the tip of Calumpang Peninsula separating Balayan Bay from Batangas Bay. The truth is, the sand here isn t as pearly white as what you would expect in Boracay or Palawan, but what Masasa Beach lacks in the brightness of its sand it makes up for in the vibrance of waves. Its crystal clear, shallow waters give off a beautiful turquoise shimmer, something that will catch your attention even from a great distance.","Masasa Beach in Tingloy The beaches in Batangas is one of the most popular Batangas tourist spots among local and foreign tourists.

Located within a lake, I've been to the volcano island to see the crater lake of the Taal Volcano. But since it's been very active since last year, going to the volcano island and hiking to the crater lake is now prohibited.  There are many hotels and resorts in Batangas where you could still enjoy the breathtaking view of the Taal Lake.","As the centerpiece of Taal Lake, it is also described as an island (Volcano Island) within a lake (Taal Lake) within an island (Luzon main island).

Before the 2020 eruption, the Volcano Island is accessible to tourists who wish to get to the edge of the crater and marvel at this small but mighty nature s wonder. While you can admire it from Tagaytay, you can go to Talisay to get closer to Taal Lake. You don t need to check in to a ridge-perched hotel to have a good look at the lake and volcano.
