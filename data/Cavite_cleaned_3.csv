The bridge, which crosses the Ylang-Ylang River, is the first large natural bridge reported in the country.","Activities: 1. Trekking There is a short trek towards the cave. It is about 20-30mins trek only. 2. Swimming At the mouth of the cave, there is a natural pool where you can plunge into. (Please avoid diving for the depths of the water is varying. You'll never know where is the deep part or the shallow part. Also, there are rocks under the water that may cause accidents.) 3. Bat sightings There are fruit bats inhabiting the cave. They have their nests at the ceiling of the cave. Just be careful not to disturb the bats so they will not roam around the cave while you are passing through.

Balite Falls,"Balite Falls is a privately owned resort. A 929-meter road from Crisanto Delos Reyes Avenue is the only access to this falls and is accessible to any type of vehicle. The resort is not a top notch class resort yet is one of the nearest waterfall spot for the people of Cavite and those coming from Manila. From Manila, it is only about an hour and a half drive along the Cavite Expressway. Cottages are available along the side of the stream and small overnight hostel is available as well as a bar. However when I was there, it seems that the bar is no longer available except for a karaoke machine. The place is suggested to be a good picnic area but not a place that would be good to stay overnight. Amenities are not that top notch. There is only a single restroom for the whole resort and 3 dressing rooms. There is no shower room as the area already has natural fresh water flowing from the pipes along the side of the stream which can be used as a shower. The water from the catch basin of the falls was artificially blocked by sand bags to maintain the basin with sufficient water for swimming. The bad thing about it is that because it is blocked and it takes time before the water to flow freely to the stream, the catch basin water tends to be murky when more people are there. Anchovies and tadpoles swim along with you. Not in great numbers though. And this is also one of the effects when you block a natural waterway, the fishes tend to stay in one place as well. The falls itself is a beauty. Not something you expect as a big waterfall as it can be safely said that Balite Falls is more of a stream as the area to where it is located is a plain land. There are no mountains nearby. Just right where the falls fall from the rock is a deep area. A rope line has been placed by the management to warn people that if you go beyond that rope and get near the falls is already 18-feet deep. Entrance fee is a bit of a turn-off. With few amenities that the resort can offer, it charges P75 per person for 7 years old and above. Much more expensive than Sto. Nino Cold Spring at Camiguin to which this resort is almost similar; that costs only P25/pax for an entrance fee. The verdict is that, Balite Falls is an ample spot for people who are on a budget and would like to swim or a have a picnic get-together with your family and friends if you happen to just had been to Tagaytay City.",,

Museo Orlina,"Museo Orlina is the showcase of the artistry of internationally acclaimed Ramon Orlina, pioneer and foremost practitioner of glass sculpture in the country. Before Orlina, glass was largely appreciated only for its utilitarian function: as drinking vessels, window glass panes or automotive windshields. A visionary, Orlina saw beyond the humble origin of this industrial glass residue. The result is an exultant body of works that, through the decades, have dazzled the art scene and prized by numerous collectors. Triumphantly, Orlina has transformed the medium by elevating it to the dignity and respectability of art. The Museo Orlina opens its door to the public, where they can view superb examples of Ramon Orlina s scintillating artistry to their delight and enchantment. Orlina s contribution to society both to its spirit  and the economy, is witnessed by the major commissions he has received. The first, ARCANUM XIX, Paradise Gained, greeted me in the foyer of the  Silahis Hotel on the first day of my first visit to the Philippines in 1976. In the 1970s, few large-scale contemporary glass works existed anywhere in the world. This work gave the lie to the popular notion that contemporary glass was a creature of Europe and North America.",,
